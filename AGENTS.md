# Agent instructions

## Build artifact cleanup (disk space)

Rust/Tauri build output in this repo grows into tens of GB and Cargo never prunes it.
Clean it up **only once testing is done**. Never clean up partway through a task.

### When to clean up
Run the cleanup **only when all of these are true**:
1. The task's work is finished. No more code changes are planned in this session.
2. The relevant tests/builds have run and **passed**. If anything is failing, leave the
   artifacts in place: they are needed to debug and rebuilding them takes many minutes.
3. The user hasn't asked for a build output they still need to collect, such as an installer
   or bundle under `target/release/bundle`. If one exists, ask before deleting it.

Do **not** clean up between iterations, after a single test run, or "just to be tidy".
Rebuilding from scratch is slow.

### How to clean up
First stop any running `tauri dev` / `cargo` / app processes, because Windows locks files in use. Then:

```powershell
cargo clean                                  # repo root: target/ (debug + release)
cargo clean --manifest-path spikes/spike-a/Cargo.toml
```

Agent worktrees under `.claude/worktrees/`: once their work is merged, run `git -C <worktree> status`.
If it shows no uncommitted changes, run `git worktree remove <path>`. Never force-remove a worktree that has uncommitted changes.

Afterwards, tell the user what was removed and roughly how much space was freed.
